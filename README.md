## Known Issues

- Board detection may struggle with non-standard board themes
- Very small board sizes (< 200px) may not be detected reliably
- Some piece sets may require custom templates

## FAQ

**Q: Which chess engine should I use?**
A: Stockfish is recommended. Download the latest version from [stockfishchess.org](https://stockfishchess.org/download/).

**Q: Why isn't my board being detected?**
A: Ensure the board is clearly visible and try adjusting the Canny thresholds in Settings. Enable "Debug Cells" to see what ChessDroid is detecting.

**Q: Can I use this on Mac or Linux?**
A: Currently ChessDroid is Windows-only. Cross-platform support may be added in the future.

**Q: Is this tool allowed on chess platforms?**
A: No. Using analysis tools during live games violates most chess platform terms of service and is considered cheating.
